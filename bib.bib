abstract     = {<p>An overwhelming number of news articles are available every day via the
                internet. Unfortunately, it is impossible for us to peruse more than a handful;
                furthermore it is difficult to ascertain an article’s social context, i.e., is it
                popular, what sorts of people are reading it, etc. In this paper, we develop a
                system to address this problem in the restricted domain of political news by
                harnessing implicit and explicit contextual information from the blogosphere.
                Specifically, we track thousands of blogs and the news articles they cite,
                collapsing news articles that have highly overlapping content. We then tag each
                article with the number of blogs citing it, the political orientation of those
                blogs, and the level of emotional charge expressed in the blog posts that link to
                the news article. We summarize and present the results to the user via a novel
                visualization which displays this contextual information; the user can then find
                the most popular articles, the articles most cited by liberals, the articles most
                emotionally discussed in the political blogosphere, etc.</p>},

As a step towards interconnecting the Web of Documents with the Web of Data, we developed DBpedia Spotlight, a system for automatically annotating text documents with DBpedia URIs. DBpedia Spotlight allows users to configure the annotations to their specific needs through the DBpedia Ontology and quality measures such as prominence, topical pertinence, contextual ambiguity and disambiguation confidence. We compare our approach with the state of the art in disambiguation, and evaluate our results in light of three baselines and six publicly available annotation systems, demonstrating the competitiveness of our system.

As a step towards interconnecting the Web of Documents with the Web of Data, we developed DBpedia Spotlight, a system for automatically annotating text documents with DBpedia URIs. DBpedia Spotlight allows users to configure the annotations to their specific needs through the DBpedia Ontology and quality measures such as prominence, topical pertinence, contextual ambiguity and disambiguation confidence. We compare our approach with the state of the art in disambiguation, and evaluate our results in light of three baselines and six publicly available annotation systems, demonstrating the competitiveness of our system. DBpedia Spotlight is shared as open source and deployed as a Web Service freely available for public use.},
